 Project Overview
The AI Visual Cryptarithm Solver is designed to take a cryptarithmetic equation with letters in place of digits and solve it by inferring the correct digit-letter mapping. 
The system uses logical constraints to reduce possibilities and finds the valid mapping that satisfies the equation. 

Features
 -> Solves cryptarithmetic equations by inferring digit-letter mappings.
 -> User-friendly interface to input cryptarithmetic problems.
 -> AI-based constraint satisfaction approach for solving equations.
 -> Can handle multiple cryptarithmetic puzzles with varying levels of difficulty.
 -> Visual representation of the solution process.

Technologies Used
 -> Programming Language: Python
 -> Libraries/User Interface: custom tkinter
 -> AI/Algorithm: Constraint satisfaction, backtracking, and logical inference techniques

 Run/Output
Change GUI interface main screen by downloading the screenshot file and changing its path in the code.
